## **Troubleshooting & Best Practices**

### **9.1 Common Technical Issues**
- **Performance Lag**: Optimize React components using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
- **Firebase Sync Errors**: Add retry logic and offline persistence.
- **TypeScript Errors**: Use strict mode and define interfaces for data consistency.

### **9.2 Best Practices**
- **Code Quality**:  
  - Follow Airbnb TypeScript style guide.  
  - Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.  

- **Testing**:  
  - Unit tests with Jest:  
    ```tsx
    // src/components/__tests__/CatProfile.test.tsx
    import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
    import CatProfile from '../CatProfile';

    test('updates cat name on input change', () => {
      render(<CatProfile />);
      const input = screen.getByLabelText('Name');
      fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: 'Mittens' } });
      expect(input).toHaveValue('Mittens');
    });
    ```

- **Security**:  
  - Use Firebase Authentication for user login.  
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., health records).
