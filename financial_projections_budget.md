interface Cat {
  name: string;
  breed: string;
  age: number;
}

const CatProfile: React.FC = () => {
  const [cat, setCat] = useState<Cat>({ name: 'Whiskers', breed: 'Siamese', age: 3 });

  const updateCat = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setCat({ ...cat, [name]: value });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{cat.name}</h1>
      <p>Breed: {cat.breed}</p>
      <p>Age: {cat.age} years</p>
      <input name="name" value={cat.name} onChange={updateCat} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### **Firebase Authentication Setup**
```javascript
// src/firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDw...",
  authDomain: "cat-app.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "cat-app",
  storageBucket: "cat-app.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "1234567890",
  appId: "1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);

export const login = (email: string, password: string) => {
  return signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
};
```
