### 5.3 Best Practices for Development  

#### 5.3.1 Code Quality

- **React**: Prefer functional components and hooks over class components.  

#### 5.3.2 Testing  
- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library.  
  ```ts  
  // src/components/CatCard.test.tsx  
  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';  
  import CatCard from './CatCard';  

  test('renders cat card with name and image', () => {  
    render(<CatCard name="Whiskers" image="whiskers.jpg" />);  
    expect(screen.getByText('Whiskers')).toBeInTheDocument();  
  });  
  ```

## 6. Troubleshooting and Common Issues  

### 6.1 Common Errors and Solutions  

#### 6.1.1 TypeScript Errors  
- **Error**: `Property 'name' does not exist on type '{}'`  
  **Solution**: Define an interface for the component props.  

#### 6.1.2 Firebase Authentication Issues
