import { fetchCats } from '../api';

interface Cat {
  id: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  owner: string;
}

const CatFeed: React.FC = () => {
  const [cats, setCats] = useState<Cat[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCats().then(setCats);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {cats.map((cat) => (
        <div key={cat.id} className="border p-2">
          <img src={cat.imageUrl} alt={cat.owner} />
          <p>Posted by: {cat.owner}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CatFeed;
```

### **5.2 TypeScript Interface: Cat Data Model**
