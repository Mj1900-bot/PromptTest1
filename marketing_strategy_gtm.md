  const AuthProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
    const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

    const login = (user: User) => setUser(user);
    const logout = () => setUser(null);

    return (
      <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
        {children}
      </AuthContext.Provider>

## 7. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### 7.1 Common Technical Issues
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Optimize image loading with lazy loading.
  ```tsx
  // Lazy Loading Images
  const LazyImage = React.lazy(() => import('./components/LazyImage'));
  ```
- **TypeScript Errors**: Use strict mode and define interfaces.
  ```json
  // tsconfig.json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true
    }
  }
  ```

### 7.2 Best Practices
- **Code Quality**: Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
  ```
- **Security**: Enable Firebase security rules and HTTPS for all API calls.
